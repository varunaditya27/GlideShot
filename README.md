# üèåÔ∏è GlideShot

Refined browser-based 3D mini‚Äëgolf built with Next.js, React Three Fiber, and Firebase.

</div>

## Overview

GlideShot is a focused, minimal mini‚Äëgolf prototype. It implements a small but polished feature set: smooth camera follow, lightweight custom physics, intuitive drag‚Äëto‚Äëaim controls with an optimized aim assist, a concise HUD, and persistent scoring with a per‚Äëlevel leaderboard backed by Firebase. All documentation below reflects the current codebase only‚Äîno hypothetical or unimplemented functionality is described as present.

## Implemented Feature Set

| Area | Implemented |
|------|-------------|
| Rendering | React Three Fiber + Three.js scene (single procedural course per level) |
| Levels | 3 JSON‚Äëdefined levels (`public/levels/level-1..3.json`) with name, description, start, hole, par |
| Physics | Custom loop: velocity integration, frame‚Äërate independent damping, boundary bounce, hole radius detection |
| Input | Mouse drag to aim + power (no keyboard controls implemented) |
| Aim Assist | Predictive decay dots, direction line + glow, ghost ball, dynamic color by power |
| UI | HUD (strokes, par, relative score, power bar with ticks), leaderboard panel, hole completion notice |
| Particles & FX | Bounce burst, goal burst, hole pulse, subtle audio beeps (Web Audio) |
| Camera | Smooth follow rig with damping offset |
| Persistence | Score saving on hole completion; per‚Äëlevel leaderboard sorted by strokes |
| Auth | Firebase Auth (email/password supported via existing hook) |
| Backend | `/api/scores/get` & `/api/scores/post` (Node runtime) using Firebase Admin SDK |
| Data Model | Firestore collections: `users/{uid}/scores/{levelId}` & `leaderboard/{levelId}/entries/{uid}` |
| Performance Practices | Refs to avoid re‚Äërenders, preallocated vectors/meshes, minimal per‚Äëframe GC, no heavyweight physics engine |

## Not (Yet) Implemented (Explicitly Out of Scope Right Now)

Replay camera, spin / wind, moving obstacles, skins, social sharing, daily challenges, friend challenges, achievements, dynamic weather, accessibility modes beyond basic semantic HTML, keyboard navigation, level selector UI. Some of these appear in historical planning documents but are not active features.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/varunaditya27/GlideShot.git
cd GlideShot
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 and proceed to /game.

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` with (client keys are safe for exposure in browser):

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=...

# Server-side (do NOT expose these publicly)
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=...
FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=...
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
```

`firebaseConfig.ts` consumes only `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` values. Admin SDK initialization in `firebaseAdmin.ts` is guarded‚Äîif the private key env vars are absent, API routes still warn gracefully.

## Gameplay Loop

1. Drag from ball to set direction + power.
2. Release: shot velocity applied (`power * 2`).
3. Per‚Äëframe update: velocity damped (`0.98^(dt*60)`), boundary collision flips velocity component *0.8, position advanced.
4. Hole detection: distance < 0.25 and speed < 1.5 ‚Üí score saved ‚Üí transition to next level after delay.
5. Leaderboard endpoint stores user score (merging strokes + par + timestamp) and updates per‚Äëlevel entry.

## Data Model (Firestore)

```
users/{uid}/scores/{levelId}
	strokes: number
	par: number | null
	timestamp: Date

leaderboard/{levelId}/entries/{uid}
	uid: string
	name: string | null
	strokes: number
	par: number | null
	timestamp: Date
```

## Level Definition

Each level config (JSON) includes:

```jsonc
{
	"name": "Classic Starter",
	"description": "Straight fairway with a single hole.",
	"model": "",           // (Unused placeholder in current prototype)
	"start": [0, 0.2, 10],
	"hole": [0, 0.01, -10],
	"par": 3,
	"obstacles": []         // Currently unused by logic
}
```

The in‚Äëscene geometry is procedural (`Level.tsx`)‚Äîrectangular ground + boundary walls + hole + flag.

## Performance Notes

* No physics engine; bespoke minimal math.
* Predictive aim assist preallocates vectors & meshes; only mutates.
* Particle bursts & hole pulse reuse objects; zero per‚Äëframe allocations for geometry.
* Camera rig smoothing uses simple lerp‚Äîno re‚Äërenders triggered by React state per frame.
* Turbopack build; small dependency surface for 3D (three + R3F + drei subset).

## Folder Structure (Relevant Portions)

```
src/
	app/
		page.tsx          # Landing page
		game/page.tsx     # Game UI + canvas
		api/scores/(get|post)/route.ts
	components/
		game/             # Level, Ball, PlayerControls, CameraRig, AimAssist
		ui/               # HUD, Leaderboard
	lib/                # firebaseConfig, firebaseAdmin
public/
	levels/             # level-1..3.json
docs/                 # Architecture, backend, gameplay, physics, ui, levels, roadmap, performance
```

## Security / Operational Notes

* Keep Admin credentials out of version control; rotate if exposed.

* Client only imports the `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` Firebase keys.

* API routes run in Node runtime, using Admin SDK to merge leaderboard + user score writes.
